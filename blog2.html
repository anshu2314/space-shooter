        <h1>3 Essential Tips to Dominate in Space Shooter X</h1>
        <p>So, you've jumped into the cockpit of Space Shooter X and are blasting through alien fleets. But are you surviving as long as you could be? To turn you from a rookie pilot into a seasoned ace, here are three essential tips to help you rack up a higher score and defeat the toughest bosses.</p>

        <h2>Tip 1: The Nova Pulse is Your Best Friend</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Nova Pulse (Key 3)</strong> might seem like just another attack, but its true power is defensive. When you're swarmed by enemies and enemy bullets are closing in, a single press of this button can save you. The Nova Pulse instantly destroys all nearby projectiles and pushes enemies back, giving you precious breathing room to reposition. Don't save it for a special occasionâ€”use it to escape certain doom!
        </p>

        <h2>Tip 2: Master the Art of the Combo</h2>
        <p>
            Notice that "Combo" meter? It's the key to a massive score. To activate it, you need to destroy 5 enemies in quick succession (within about 4 seconds). Once active, your score multiplier kicks in, and every kill is worth more. To keep the combo going, you need to play aggressively. Don't just survive; hunt down enemies and chain your kills together.
        </p>

        <h2>Tip 3: Know the Right Tool for the Job</h2>
        <p>
            Each special move is designed for a specific situation. Using the right one at the right time is crucial for clearing waves and taking down bosses.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beam Attack (Key 1):</strong> This is your boss-killer and line-clearer. When enemies are flying in a straight line or you need to deal focused, sustained damage to a boss, unleash the beam for devastating results.</li>
            <li><strong>Gaze Burst (Key 2):</strong> Facing a wide screen full of smaller, scattered enemies? The Gaze Burst is perfect. It fires a wide cone of projectiles that can clear out multiple threats at once.</li>
            <li><strong>Nova Pulse (Key 3):</strong> As mentioned before, this is your ultimate defensive tool. Use it when you're trapped and need to reset the situation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By mastering these three tips, you'll see your scores climb and your survival time increase. Now get back in there and show those aliens who's boss!</p>
